# PyBacker
A backup daemon written in Python to help you maintain files in the event they are lost or deleted on accident.

You can set a source directory to a backup directory to create a backup chain for double/triple/... backups.

## To-Do:
- Add command line args for CLI operation and a GUI.
- Add the ability to backup over FTP / SFTP
